# VA Software-as-a-Service 

### Note some of the links in this public repository have restricted access to VA employees/contractors with access to the VA network.

Software-as-a-Service products represent a key opportunity for OIT to support VA’s modernization mission. When compared to building custom solutions, adopting SaaS products can provide many potential benefits to VA, including faster delivery of capabilities, lower operational complexity and higher-quality solutions.
Though VA has already adopted many SaaS products, there remains a high degree of confusion in OIT and the VA business lines about how – and whether – VA can use such services. This is because the model for Software-as-a-Service is quite different than VA’s traditional approach to software management in which VA procures licenses to software which we then install on infrastructure VA directly controls, and assume responsibility for securing, operating and maintaining that software over time. By contrast, in the SaaS model the vendor is responsible for these operational details.
